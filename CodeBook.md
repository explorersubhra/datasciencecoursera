## Data Source
#### This dataset is derived from the following url 
-https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
####The features for this database derived from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 hz.Then were processed with suitable filters to remove noise. The with another low pass filter acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals.
